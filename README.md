# fillit
This is the story of a piece of Tetris, one little square and a dev walk into a bar...

## Introduction
Fillit is a project that let me discover and/or familiarize myself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, I'll have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square. <br /><br />
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.
