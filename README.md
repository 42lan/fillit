# fillit
This is the story of a piece of Tetris, one little square and a dev walk into a bar...

## Introduction
Fillit is a project that let me discover and familiarize myself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, I'll have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square. <br /><br />
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.

## Goals
Fillit is not about recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game. My program will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them in order to create the smallest square possible. <br /><br />
Obviously, my main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.<br /><br /> I should think carefully about how I'll structure my data and how to solve this problem, if I want my program answers before the next millenium.
